                    abstract: "As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become more common on public roads, their interaction with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in mixed traffic is inevitable. This requires new control strategies for AVs to handle the unpredictable nature of HVs. This study focused on safe control in mixed-vehicle platoons consisting of both AVs and HVs, particularly during longitudinal car-following scenarios. We introduce a novel model that combines a conventional first-principles model with a Gaussian process (GP) machine learning-based model to better predict HV behavior. Our results showed a significant improvement in predicting HV speed, with a 35.64% reduction in the root mean square error compared with the use of the first-principles model alone. We developed a new control strategy called GP-MPC, which uses the proposed HV model for safer distance management between vehicles in the mixed platoon. The GP-MPC strategy effectively utilizes the capacity of the GP model to assess uncertainties, thereby significantly enhancing safety in challenging traffic scenarios, such as emergency braking scenarios. In simulations, the GP-MPC strategy outperformed the baseline MPC method, offering better safety and more efficient vehicle movement in mixed traffic.",

This study introduces a learning-based method for modeling HV behavior, combining a traditional first-principles approach with a Gaussian process (GP) learning component. This hybrid model enhances the accuracy of velocity predictions and provides measurable uncertainty estimates. We leverage this model to develop a GP-based model predictive control (GP-MPC) strategy to improve safety in mixed vehicle platoons by integrating uncertainty assessments into distance constraints. Comparative simulations between our GP-MPC approach and a conventional model predictive control (MPC) strategy reveal that the GP-MPC ensures safer distancing and more efficient travel within the mixed platoon. By incorporating sparse GP modeling for HVs and a dynamic GP prediction in MPC, we significantly reduce the computation time of GP-MPC, making it only marginally longer than standard MPC and approximately 100 times faster than previous models not employing these techniques. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of learning-based HV modeling in enhancing safety and efficiency in mixed-traffic environments involving AV and HV interactions.",

This paper introduces an advanced method for modeling HV behavior, combining a first-principles model with Gaussian process (GP) learning to enhance velocity prediction accuracy and provide a measurable uncertainty. We validated this innovative HV model using real-world data from field experiments and applied it to develop a GP-enhanced model predictive control (GP-MPC) strategy. This strategy aims to improve safety in mixed vehicle platoons by integrating uncertainty assessment into distance constraints. Comparative simulation studies with a conventional model predictive control (MPC) approach demonstrated that our GP-MPC strategy ensures more reliable safe distancing and fosters efficient vehicular dynamics, achieving notably higher speeds within the platoon. By incorporating a sparse GP technique in HV modeling and adopting a dynamic GP prediction within the MPC framework, we significantly reduced the computation time of GP-MPC, marking it only 4.6% higher than that of the conventional MPC. This represents a substantial improvement, making the process about 100 times faster than our preliminary work without these approximations. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of learning-based HV modeling in enhancing both safety and operational efficiency in mixed-traffic environments, paving the way for more harmonious AV-HV interactions.",

It begins with GP regression fundamentals, illustrating how it enriches MPC with enhanced predictive accuracy and robust handling of uncertainties. A central contribution of this tutorial is the first detailed, systematic mathematical formulation of GP-MPC in literature, focusing on deriving the approximation of means and variances propagation for GP multi-step predictions. Practical applications in robotics control, such as path-following for mobile robots in challenging terrains and mixed-vehicle platooning, are discussed to demonstrate the real-world effectiveness and adaptability of GP-MPC.

However, automating these transitions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce a method designed for autonomous mode transition in a quadruped hybrid robot with a track/wheel-legged configuration, especially during step negotiation. Our approach hinges on a decision-making mechanism that evaluates the energy efficiency of both locomotion modes using a proposed energy-based criterion. To guarantee a smooth negotiation of steps, we incorporate two climbing gaits designated for the assessment of energy usage in walking locomotion. Simulation results validate the method‚Äôs effectiveness, showing successful autonomous transitions across steps of diverse heights. Our suggested approach has universal applicability and can be modified to suit other hybrid robots of similar mechanical configuration, provided their locomotion energy performance is studied beforehand.",

The algorithm uses a nominal kinematic model and learns unmodeled dynamics as GP models by using observation data collected during field experiments. Extensive outdoor experiments using a Clearpath Husky A200 mobile robot show that the proposed GP‚ÄêFBLMPC algorithm's performance is comparable to existing GP learning‚Äêbased nonlinear MPC (GP‚ÄêNMPC) methods with respect to the path following errors. The advantage of GP‚ÄêFBLMPC is that it is generalizable in reducing path following errors for different paths that are not included in the GP models training process, while GP‚ÄêNMPC methods only work well on exactly the same path on which GP models are trained. GP‚ÄêFBLMPC is also computationally more efficient than the GP‚ÄêNMPC because it does not conduct iterative optimization and requires fewer GP models to make predictions over the MPC prediction horizon loop at every time step. Field tests show the effectiveness and generalization of reducing path following errors of the GP‚ÄêFBLMPC algorithm. It requires little training data to perform GP modeling before it can be used to reduce path‚Äêfollowing errors for new, more complex paths on the same terrain (see video at https://youtu.be/tC09jJQ0OXM).",

However, to the best of our knowledge, there are very few reported quantitative comparisons of the most widely-used robot simulation tools. This article attempts to partly fill this gap by providing quantitative and objective comparisons of four widely-used simulation packages for mobile robots. The comparisons reported here were conducted by obtaining data from a real Husky A200 mobile robot driving on mixed terrains as ground truth and by simulating a 3D mobile robot model in a developed identical simulation world of these terrains for each simulator. We then compared the simulation outputs with real, measured results by weighted metrics. Based on our experiments and selected metrics, we conclude that CoppeliaSim is currently the best performing simulator, although Gazebo is not far behind and is a good alternative.",

                    abstract: "Along with the advancement of light-weight sensing and processing technologies, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently become popular platforms for intelligent traffic monitoring and control. UAV-mounted cameras can capture traffic-flow videos from various perspectives providing a comprehensive insight into road conditions. To analyze the traffic flow from remotely captured videos, a reliable and accurate vehicle detection-and-tracking approach is required. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning framework for vehicle detection and tracking from UAV videos for monitoring traffic flow in complex road structures. This approach is designed to be invariant to significant orientation and scale variations in the videos. The detection procedure is performed by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art object detector, You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), using several custom-labeled traffic datasets. Vehicle tracking is conducted following a tracking-by-detection paradigm, where deep appearance features are used for vehicle re-identification, and Kalman filtering is used for motion estimation. The proposed methodology is tested on a variety of real videos collected by UAVs under various conditions, e.g., in late afternoons with long vehicle shadows, in dawn with vehicles lights being on, over roundabouts and interchange roads where vehicle directions change considerably, and from various viewpoints where vehicles‚Äô appearance undergo substantial perspective distortions. The proposed tracking-by-detection approach performs efficiently at 11 frames per second on color videos of 2720p resolution. Experiments demonstrated that high detection accuracy could be achieved with an average F1-score of 92.1%. Besides, the tracking technique performs accurately, with an average multiple-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of 81.3%. The proposed approach also addressed the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art in multi-object tracking regarding frequent identity switching, resulting in a total of only one identity switch over every 305 tracked vehicles.",

                    abstract: "In this paper, a solution for vehicle speed estimation using unmanned aerial videos is described. First, convolutional neural networks and Kalman filtering using deep features are used for detecting and tracking vehicles. Then, a photogrammetric approach is developed for estimating the three-dimensional (3D) position of the tracked vehicles on the road, which allows determining their speed. No assumptions are made about either the 3D structure of the road (e.g., constraining it to be a planar surface) or the camera pose (e.g., restricting it to be stationary). Therefore, this solution applies to videos acquired by a moving unmanned aerial vehicle from complex road structures (e.g., multi-level highways). This solution is also robust to changes of viewpoint and scale, which makes it applicable to situations where cars undergo orientation and resolution changes as observed from the sky (e.g., in roundabouts). Experiments showed that a high detection accuracy could be achieved with an F1-score of 94.54%. Besides, the tracking technique performed well, with a multiple-object tracking accuracy of 89.8% at a speed of 11 frames per second on videos of 2720x1530 pixels. Vehicle positioning (and thus, speed estimation) could be performed with an average accuracy of 0.6 m.",
